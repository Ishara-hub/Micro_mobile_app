# Mobile App Development Guide for Microfinance Payment System

## Overview

This guide provides a comprehensive approach to developing a mobile app for the microfinance payment system. The app will allow field agents to process payments, search for loans, and manage member information on-the-go.

## Architecture

### Backend API (Laravel)
- **Authentication**: Laravel Sanctum for API token authentication
- **Payment Processing**: RESTful API endpoints for payment operations
- **Loan Management**: APIs for loan search and installment tracking
- **Member Management**: APIs for member information and payment history

### Mobile App Options

#### 1. React Native (Recommended)
- **Pros**: Cross-platform (iOS & Android), large community, excellent performance
- **Cons**: Learning curve for React ecosystem
- **Best for**: Rapid development with native performance

#### 2. Flutter
- **Pros**: Single codebase, excellent performance, Google backing
- **Cons**: Smaller ecosystem compared to React Native
- **Best for**: Teams familiar with Dart

#### 3. Native Development
- **Pros**: Best performance, platform-specific features
- **Cons**: Separate codebases for iOS and Android
- **Best for**: Complex apps requiring platform-specific features

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
```
POST /api/auth/login
POST /api/auth/register
POST /api/auth/logout
GET /api/auth/profile
```

### Payment Processing
```
