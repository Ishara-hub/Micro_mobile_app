```typescript
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://your-laravel-backend.com/api';
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
```

## API Endpoints

The app expects the following Laravel backend endpoints:

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - User logout
- `GET /api/auth/profile` - Get user profile

### Payment Processing
- `POST /api/mobile/search-loan` - Search loan by ID or NIC
- `GET /api/mobile/loan/{id}/details` - Get loan details
- `GET /api/mobile/loan/{id}/installments` - Get loan installments
- `POST /api/mobile/process-payment` - Process payment
- `GET /api/mobile/payment/{id}/receipt` - Get payment receipt

### Member Management
- `GET /api/mobile/member/{id}/profile` - Get member profile
- `GET /api/mobile/member/{id}/loans` - Get member loans
- `GET /api/mobile/member/{id}/payment-history` - Get payment history

## Usage

### For Field Agents

1. **Login**: Enter your email and password to access the app
2. **Search Loans**: Use the search function to find loans by ID or NIC
3. **Process Payments**: Select installments and process payments
4. **View History**: Check payment history and member profiles

### Offline Mode

The app supports offline functionality:
- Payments are stored locally when offline
- Data syncs when connection is restored
- Search history is cached locally

## Development

### Adding New Screens

1. Create a new screen component in `src/screens/`
2. Add the screen to the navigation in `src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx`
3. Update the navigation types if needed

### Adding New API Endpoints

1. Add the endpoint to the appropriate API service in `src/api/`
2. Create Redux actions in the relevant slice
3. Update TypeScript types if needed

### Styling

The app uses a consistent design system:
- Primary color: `#007AFF`
- Secondary color: `#F2F2F7`
- Error color: `#FF3B30`
- Text colors: `#000000`, `#8E8E93`

## Testing
